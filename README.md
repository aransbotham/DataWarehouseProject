# Project 2: Data Warehouse

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights into what songs their users are listening to.

# ETL Pipeline

An RDS cluster is spun up and data is raw data is moved from the designated S3 bucket into Redshift for staging. Staging data is then transformed as needed to be copied into appropriate Fact and Dimension tables to enable company reporting and analysis.

## Utility and Query Files
1. `queries/sql_queries.py`: File that houses all queries for dropping and creating tables as well as copying and inserting data into tables.
2. `utils/redshift_utils.py`: A module created to house common functions to reduce amount of repeated code in main notebook.
    - `create_role`: Provisions IAM role for RDS cluster.
    - `create_cluster`: Provisions RDS cluster.
    - `execute_sql_queries`: Submits query via database connection.
    - `execute_qa_count_queries`: Executes a table count on all tables provided.
    - `execute_qa_row_queries`: Executes a row of 1 query on all tables provided. 

## Scripts
1. `scripts/create_tables.py`: Houses function to create all tables.
2. `scriptsetl.py`: Houses function to run ETL pipeline.



# Tables
Below is an ERD representing the relationship between all tables created as part of the ETL process.

## Staging

1. `staging_events`: Events in log data associated with song plays.

> The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator(opens in a new tab) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

2. `staging_songs`: All song data from Sparkify.

 > The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset(opens in a new tab). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.

## Dimensional Model (DIMM)
### Facts
1. `songplays`: A table with all song plays by users on Sparkify with the fields songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent.

### Dimensions
1. `users`: A table for all Sparkify users with fields user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level.
2. `artists`: A table for all artists on Sparkify with fields artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
3. `songs`: A table for all songs on Sparkify with fields song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
4. `time`: A table for housing all time increments relevant for reporting at Sparkify with fields start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday.

# Analysis

The analytics team at Sparkify is interested in finding insights into what songs their users are listening to. The following queries will help them get started.

## Which songs are getting the most user's listening?
```sql
SELECT a.name as artist, s.title AS song, count(distinct user_id) AS users_listening
FROM songplays sp 
JOIN songs s ON (s.song_id = sp.song_id) 
JOIN artists a ON (a.artist_id = sp.artist_id)
GROUP BY a.name, song
ORDER BY count(distinct user_id) desc
LIMIT 5;
```

## Which songs are getting the most plays?
```sql
SELECT a.name as artist, s.title AS song, count(*) AS users_listening
FROM songplays sp 
JOIN songs s ON (s.song_id = sp.song_id) 
JOIN artists a ON (a.artist_id = sp.artist_id)
GROUP BY a.name, song
ORDER BY count(*) desc
LIMIT 5;
```

## Which users are listening to the largest variety of songs?
```sql
SELECT t.hour as hour, count(hour) AS frequency
FROM songplays sp
JOIN time t
    ON sp.time_id = t.time_id
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY count(*) desc
LIMIT 5;
```

## What hour of the day has the most songplays?
```sql
SELECT t.hour, count(*) AS frequency
FROM songplays sp
JOIN time t
    ON sp.time_id = t.time_id
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY count(*) desc
LIMIT 5;
```

## How does listening behavior differ by day of the week in terms of the hour with the most songplays?
```sql
SELECT t.weekday, t.hour, count(*) AS frequency
FROM songplays sp
JOIN time t
    ON sp.time_id = t.time_id
GROUP BY weekday, hour
ORDER BY count(*) desc
LIMIT 10
```
